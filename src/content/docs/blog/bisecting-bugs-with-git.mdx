## The problem

A couple of days ago while working on my blog, I found out that the full-text site search didn't work anymore. On the desktop, I couldn't see the search UI at all as seen in the following screenshot.

![Desktop search UI missing](../../../assets/bisecting-bugs-with-git/desktop-search-missing.png)

And mobile search UI looked pretty strange with two search inputs...

<div class="sl-flex justify-center">
    <Image src={mobileSearchUiImage} alt="Two search input in mobile view..." width="360px" />
</div>

Something was wrong and I needed to get to the bottom of it. At the time I noticed the issue I was setting up [astro-compress][astroCompress] to compress static assets after the build. I thought maybe something went wrong during the compression so I tried excluding `pagefind` ([Starlight][starlight] uses [Pagefind][pagefind] to implement full-text site search):

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={6-8}
import compress from "astro-compress";

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
        compress({
            Exclude: [
                file => file.includes('pagefind')
            ]
        }),
	],
});
```

Neither excluding these assets nor disabling the compression altogether helped. It was high time to turn to [git bisect][gitBisect] for help.

## Bisecting the bug with Git

:::note
As you'll see below `git bisect` was instrumental in finding the root cause of the issue. However, it's not a silver bullet. It's not always easy to find bugs with git bisect, especially in those cases when commits are squashed at large and singular commits contain 30, 40, 100 files, etc. So to utilize this command to its best I recommend committing often and committing small changes at a time (atomic commits).
:::

[git bisect][gitBisect] is (obviously) a git command that uses binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug. It does so by asking for `good` and `bad` commits and once these commits are identified it starts halving the commits between these until the commit that introduced the bug is found.

### Locating and fixing the bug
I knew that the latest commit had the bug so it was time to start the bisecting process so I ran the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git bisect start
```

Here is the output of the command:

```bash
âžœ  bugron.github.io git:(test) git bisect start
status: waiting for both good and bad commits
âžœ  bugron.github.io git:(test) git bisect bad  
status: waiting for good commit(s), bad commit known
```

Notice there is no need to mark the very first commit as `bad` when starting to bisect as `git bisect start` already assumes that the current commit is `bad`. All I needed was to find a `good` commit and to do that I went back to the last known good commit (by `git checkout`ing older commits and checking for the existence of the bug) and ran `git bisect good`:

```bash
âžœ  bugron.github.io git:(test) git checkout 69da06aa1c9e2d620ac3ebba25ddf956c31d8cf5       
Note: switching to '69da06aa1c9e2d620ac3ebba25ddf956c31d8cf5'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 69da06a Add light and dark logo variations

âžœ  bugron.github.io git:(69da06a) git bisect good                             
Bisecting: 2 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
[d1eef597555defb5c235013142a42c82fed8120b] Add lastUpdated config
```

As you can see above I've `git checkout`ed to the `69da06aa1c9e2d620ac3ebba25ddf956c31d8cf5` commit and as it did not contain the bug I marked it as a good commit with `git bisect good`. Git immediately started the bisection process by checking out the `d1eef597555defb5c235013142a42c82fed8120b` commit and even showing a `rough` estimation of the number of remaining steps.

From now on here is the algorithm I followed:
```
1. Check if a commit contains the bug
2. If it does mark it bad with `git bisect bad`
3. If it does not mark it good with `git bisect good`
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the commit that introduced the bug is found
```

After a few iterations as the final step `git` presented me with the following commit:

```bash
âžœ  bugron.github.io git:(fc71196) git bisect good
fb05597e11b01673c133b977542c9360b9ad2619 is the first bad commit

    Enhance current header for mobile experience

 astro.config.mjs            |   3 +-
 src/components/Header.astro | 126 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

```

Interesting. The `Enhance current header for mobile experience` commit is exactly where I made some changes to the header component but I didn't change the search functionality at all. Or so I thought...

OK, let's see what this `bad` commit did with `git show fb05597e11b01673c133b977542c9360b9ad2619`. For the sake of brevity I won't show the whole output of the command but here is the relevant part:


```diff title="git show fb05597e11b01673c133b977542c9360b9ad2619" {12,20}

+               <LanguageSelect {...Astro.props} />
+       </div>
+</div>
```

Hmm, at this moment all I had were assumptions but one thing I saw was I had two "instances" of `<Search />` (remember the mobile search UI had two search inputs?) one of them should only be visible in mobile view the other one in desktop view. 

I mistakenly thought that it would be OK to do this and then just use CSS to control the visibility of the search UI but Starlight had another idea so I attempted to remove the second instance of `<Search />` and that fixed the issue. Afterwards, I simply polished the UI and [committed my changes][fixCommit]. Everything worked as expected and I deployed my changes ðŸš€

## Conclusion

[git bisect][gitBisect] is an incredibly powerful tool in the git arsenal for finding bugs if git is used correctly. It takes some discipline and practice to keep commits atomic and small but it's worth it in the long run. I highly recommend using it.

I hope you found this article useful. Until next time ðŸ‘‹
